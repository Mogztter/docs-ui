Building a graph of your data is fairly simple as the graph structure represents the real world much better than columns and rows of data.
GraphGists are teaching tools which allow you to explore how data in a particular domain would be modeled as a graph and see some example queries of that graph data.
Any developer can create a GraphGist by visiting https://portal.graphgist.org.
